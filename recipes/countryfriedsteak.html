    <h1><ins>Country Fried Steak:</ins></h1>
    <dd>This chicken fried steak recipe is one I received from a co-worker about 5 years ago.
         A Southern favorite, these crispy, breaded, tenderized cube steaks drenched in creamy 
         gravy can be served for breakfast or dinner. It's by far the best chicken fried steak 
         I've ever had. I've made this numerous times for my picky son and my Southern-raised 
         better half, as well as for other family and friends and each time, I get nothing but 
         rave reviews.</dd>

    <h5>Directions to Prepare:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Steaks
            <ul>
                <li>Start with cube steaks (tenderized round steaks). If they are thick, pound them to about 1/4-inch thickness with a meat mallet.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Season the Steaks
            <ul>
                <li>Season both sides of the steaks with salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings you prefer, such as garlic powder or paprika.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Dredging Station
            <ul>
                <li>Set up three shallow dishes: one with flour seasoned with salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper; another with beaten eggs and a splash of milk; and the third with more seasoned flour.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Dredge the Steaks
            <ul>
                <li>Coat each steak in the first dish of flour, shaking off excess.</li>
                <li>Dip the steak into the egg mixture, ensuring it’s fully coated.</li>
                <li>Finally, dredge the steak in the second dish of flour, pressing the flour onto the steak to create a good crust.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Heat the Oil
            <ul>
                <li>In a large skillet or cast-iron pan, heat about 1/4 inch of oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). You can use vegetable oil or a combination of oil and butter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fry the Steaks
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully place the breaded steaks into the hot oil.</li>
                <li>Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Drain the Steaks
            <ul>
                <li>Once the steaks are cooked, remove them from the skillet and place them on a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Gravy
            <ul>
                <li>Drain most of the oil from the skillet, leaving about 2-3 tablespoons and the browned bits.</li>
                <li>Add 2-3 tablespoons of flour to the skillet and whisk it into the oil to form a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Make the Gravy
            <ul>
                <li>Slowly whisk in about 2 cups of milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
                <li>Cook until the gravy thickens, then season with salt, pepper, and a dash of hot sauce if desired.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Serve the Steaks
            <ul>
                <li>Pour the gravy over the country fried steaks and serve hot, traditionally with mashed potatoes and green beans on the side.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
